JAPP Final Mapping

# File Overview
'FinalReport.ipynb' is the 'finished' report which is then 
turned into 'FinalReport.html'. I know you said PDF but 
I've learned that PDF doesn't mix with interactive maps
and interactive maps don't mix with quarto.
The best I could do was include video demonstration of the map
in the Final Report. I know including the maps was very important
but it just errored out whenever I included them no matter
what I did.

'JAPP.ipynb' is the playground I used, it is clean
'JAPP.py' is also clean, I wasn't sure which you prefered
'JAPP.json' is the geojson

'leftovers.py' is the code I wrote but didn't use
but I spent so much time on it that I wanted it
to be included somewhere

'quarto.qmd' was my attempt to make the maps work
'quarto.ipynb' was another attempt to make the map work

Please keep in mind that the 'StaticMap.png' is not
showing off the interactions of the actual map.
The AnimatedMap gif I included is for the report.
